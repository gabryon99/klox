## klox

This is an implementation of the _Lox_ programming language, invented by _Robert Nystrom_ in his
_Crafting Interpreters_ book.

The interpreter is implemented using Kotlin instead of Java, this explains why the _k_ before the name.

### Example

```lox
fun main() {
    print "42 is the ultimate answer.";
}
```
